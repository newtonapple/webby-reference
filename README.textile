A simple reference system built on Webby.  Designed to focus on code and tries to leverage the useful features of Webby like *wikiwords*.

h4. Advantage of using a statically generated reference system:

# Static pages are fast! Yea, like hella fast.
# Keep your text editor.
# Er, you can git it?
# Simple graphs (graphivz)
# Simple syntax highlight (CodeRay or Ultraviolet)

h4. Disadvantages of using a statically generated reference system:

# Can't edit it in the browser (yet).
# File management can be a bit of pain in the butt.
# NO custom searches (though Google could help).

h4. TODOs

* better table of content
* improvement of tabs / breadcrumbs
* a convention for automatic file managements (automatically aggregate table of content across pages)
* SEO optimizations
* more contents!
* allow browser edit (through a crazy hack maybe)?
